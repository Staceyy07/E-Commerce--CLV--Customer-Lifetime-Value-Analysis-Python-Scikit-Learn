1. Problem Statement
- The objective of this project is to analyze customer purchasing behavior to predict future customer value and provide strategic insights for improving customer retention and increasing revenue.

2. Project Overview & Tools
This project involves the analysis of customer transaction data to calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using Python. The tools and libraries utilized include:
- Lifetimes for CLV analysis
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for preprocessing

3. Installing Packages
Ensure that the necessary Python packages are installed:
- lifetimes
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

4. Importing Process
Import essential Python libraries:
- lifetimes for CLV analysis
- pandas and numpy for data manipulation
- datetime for handling date-time data
- matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
- BetaGeoFitter and GammaGammaFitter from lifetimes
- MinMaxScaler from scikit-learn

5. Data Understanding & Cleaning
- Load the transaction data.
- Inspect the data structure and summary statistics.
- Clean the data by removing invalid records, such as negative quantities and prices, and handling missing values.

6. Handling Outliers
- Define a function to cap outliers by setting extreme values to specified percentiles.
- Apply the function to relevant columns like UnitPrice and Quantity.

7. Data Modeling
- RFM Analysis
- Calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics for each customer.
- Filter out customers with insufficient purchase history.
- Frequency/Recency Analysis using BG/NBD Model
- Fit the BG/NBD model to predict the number of future purchases.
- Predict future purchases for the next 6 months.
- Monetary Value Prediction using Gamma-Gamma Model
- Fit the Gamma-Gamma model to predict the average transaction value.
- Predict the expected monetary value for future transactions.

8. Visualizations
- Histogram of predicted purchases to visualize the distribution.
- Scatter plot of frequency vs. predicted purchases, colored by recency and sized by observation period.

9. Key Insights
- Interpretation of the frequency/recency analysis to understand customer purchasing patterns.
- Analysis of predicted future purchases and monetary value to identify high-value customers.

10. Strategic Recommendations
- Develop targeted marketing strategies to retain high-value customers.
- Optimize inventory and pricing strategies based on customer purchase behavior.
- Implement personalized communication to encourage repeat purchases.
